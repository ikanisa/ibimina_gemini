# Ibimina Ambassador Playbook (Rwanda)

## 1. Onboarding a New Group
1. **Explain the Model**:
   - "This is a digital ledger for your existing group."
   - "No money is held in the app. You keep saving via MoMo as usual."
   - "The app just proves who paid what."

2. **Setup Steps**:
   - Ask the Group Leader to download "Ibimina" from Play Store.
   - Help them "Create Group".
   - **Important**: If they want a PUBLIC group, explain it requires Staff Approval (wait ~24h).
   - Show them how to share the QR code to members.

3. **Privacy first**:
   - Tell them: "Only members can see the group balance."
   - "Your phone number is hidden from other members (masked)."

## 2. Helping Users Install & Join
- **Android**: Share the APK via Xender/Nearby Share if internet is slow, OR send Play Store link.
- **Join**: Open app -> Tap "Scan QR" -> Scan Leader's phone.
- **Troubleshooting**: If QR fails, use the "Invite Link" via WhatsApp.
