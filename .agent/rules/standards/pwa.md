# PWA & Mobile-First Standard (Global)

## Must-haves
- Responsive across breakpoints (mobile first where required)
- Loading/empty/error states everywhere
- Intentional caching/offline strategy (documented)

## Mobile-first (Discovery/DineIn)
- Thumb-reachable primary actions
- Big touch targets; no hover-only controls
- Smooth transitions; no jank lists (virtualize if needed)
- “Native app-like” navigation (bottom nav or equivalent)

## Performance basics
- Route-level splitting
- Avoid giant first-load bundles
- Optimize images/fonts; avoid blocking renders
